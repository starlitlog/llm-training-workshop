Explain the difference between FLOWROLL and a moving average.
Can DIMMATCH align two lists if one of them is missing half the items?
What happens if I give FLOWROLL a PeriodCount that is larger than the available time range?
Does DIMMATCH work when the source values are scalars and the target list has 12 items?
Why can’t FLOWROLL be used to compare or merge dimensions?
