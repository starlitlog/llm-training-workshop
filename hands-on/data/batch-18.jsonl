{"prompt": "I need to calculate trailing 3-month totals for my sales analysis.", "completion": "Use `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 3, \"BACKWARD\")` to compute the trailing three-month rolling sum for each period."}
{"prompt": "I need to understand what the Direction parameter does because my results are wrong.", "completion": "Direction controls window orientation: \"BACKWARD\" gives you trailing windows (past data), \"FORWARD\" gives you leading windows (future data)."}
{"prompt": "I need a working DIMMATCH example to align my data correctly.", "completion": "Use `DIMMATCH(SourceLineItem, TargetDimension)` to align source values to the target dimension structure."}

{"prompt": "I need to know what PeriodCount=1 actually accomplishes in FLOWROLL.", "completion": "PeriodCount=1 means each window only contains the current period, so FLOWROLL returns the original values unchanged."}
{"prompt": "I need to align sales data to a different product hierarchy for my dashboard.", "completion": "Use `DIMMATCH(Sales, TargetProductList)` but ensure mapping relationships exist between source and target hierarchies."}
{"prompt": "I need to understand why the first 5 periods are blank in my FLOWROLL calculation.", "completion": "Those periods lack enough prior data to form complete windows. With PeriodCount=6, the first 5 periods can't build full windows."}
{"prompt": "I need to know if DIMMATCH requires a mapping table for my use case.", "completion": "Only if there's no direct structural compatibility. With existing parent-child relationships, explicit mappings might not be needed."}
{"prompt": "I need the correct formula for a 12-period forward rolling sum.", "completion": "Use `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 12, \"FORWARD\")` to sum the current period plus the next 11 periods."}
{"prompt": "I need to resolve DIMMATCH failures when aligning revenue to customer dimensions.", "completion": "Ensure structural compatibility exists. Verify that mapping relationships are defined between source and target hierarchies."}
{"prompt": "I need to troubleshoot unexpected FLOWROLL values in my model.", "completion": "Verify periods are chronologically ordered and confirm PeriodCount matches your intended window size."}
{"prompt": "I need to know what FLOWROLL should return when windows can't be formed.", "completion": "FLOWROLL returns blanks when there aren't enough periods at the start or end of the time range to form complete windows."}
{"prompt": "I need to confirm whether DIMMATCH works with time dimensions for my implementation.", "completion": "No. DIMMATCH is designed for structural list dimensions only, not time periods."}
{"prompt": "I need to calculate a 6-month trailing average for trend analysis.", "completion": "Use `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 6, \"BACKWARD\") / 6` - FLOWROLL gives the sum, then divide by 6 for the average."}
{"prompt": "I need to fix dimension errors that DIMMATCH keeps throwing.", "completion": "Verify both source and target dimensions are properly defined with compatible structures or explicit mappings."}
{"prompt": "I need to fix my FLOWROLL calculation that's failing due to period ordering.", "completion": "FLOWROLL requires chronological ordering. Reorder your periods chronologically to build valid rolling windows."}
{"prompt": "I need to map product SKUs to regional hierarchies in my planning model.", "completion": "Create a mapping table linking SKUs to regions, then use `DIMMATCH(SKUData, RegionList)` to align values."}
{"prompt": "I need to confirm FLOWROLL can handle negative values in my financial data.", "completion": "Yes. FLOWROLL includes negative values in rolling sums just like positive values."}
{"prompt": "I need to fix DIMMATCH returning only partial alignment results.", "completion": "Some source items lack mapping relationships. Add complete mappings for all leaf-level members."}
{"prompt": "I need to know the minimum valid PeriodCount for my FLOWROLL implementation.", "completion": "PeriodCount must be at least 1, though values below 2 don't create meaningful rolling windows."}
{"prompt": "I need a systematic approach to debug DIMMATCH alignment failures.", "completion": "Verify structural compatibility, check mapping table completeness, and ensure all required relationships are defined."}
{"prompt": "I need to eliminate sudden jumps in my FLOWROLL trend analysis.", "completion": "Jumps occur when large values enter or leave the rolling window. Check input data for spikes or gaps."}
{"prompt": "I need to implement FLOWROLL for weekly reporting periods.", "completion": "FLOWROLL works with any sequential time periods including weeks, months, quarters, or custom calendars."}
{"prompt": "I need to handle DIMMATCH errors when dimensions don't match.", "completion": "DIMMATCH returns blanks or errors for items without structural compatibility or mapping relationships. This is expected behavior."}
{"prompt": "I need to calculate quarter-to-date totals using FLOWROLL.", "completion": "Use `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 3, \"BACKWARD\")` to get quarterly totals aligned to each month within the quarter."}
{"prompt": "I need to fix DIMMATCH ignoring certain hierarchy levels in my structure.", "completion": "DIMMATCH requires explicit mappings at all levels. Add parent-child relationships for missing levels."}
{"prompt": "I need to understand when to use BACKWARD versus FORWARD for my analysis.", "completion": "BACKWARD creates trailing windows (historical data), FORWARD creates leading windows (future data)."}
{"prompt": "I need DIMMATCH to work across multiple models in my application.", "completion": "Not possible. DIMMATCH works within a single model using internal structural relationships and mappings."}
{"prompt": "I need to understand why reordering periods changed my FLOWROLL results.", "completion": "Period order determines window composition. Maintain chronological ordering for correct rolling calculations."}
{"prompt": "I need to implement filtering correctly with DIMMATCH in my workflow.", "completion": "Apply DIMMATCH first, then filter. DIMMATCH operates on full dimensional structure before filtering takes effect."}
{"prompt": "I need to know if there's a PeriodCount limit I should be aware of.", "completion": "No hard limit exists, but PeriodCount exceeding available periods returns blanks for all windows."}
{"prompt": "I need to understand why DIMMATCH duplicates values across my hierarchy.", "completion": "The target dimension has child nodes, so DIMMATCH expands values to all applicable members in the target structure."}

{"prompt": "I need to verify FLOWROLL compatibility with our fiscal calendar.", "completion": "FLOWROLL works with fiscal calendars if periods are properly sequenced in chronological order within the model."}
{"prompt": "I need to fix DIMMATCH ignoring newly added items in my hierarchy.", "completion": "Add mapping entries for the new items to include them in dimensional alignment."}
{"prompt": "I need to handle blanks at the boundaries of my FLOWROLL time range.", "completion": "FLOWROLL returns blanks when windows extend beyond available periods at the start or end of the range."}
{"prompt": "I need to combine FLOWROLL and DIMMATCH in a single calculation.", "completion": "Use `DIMMATCH(FLOWROLL(LineItem, 6, \"BACKWARD\"), TargetDim)` - apply FLOWROLL first, then DIMMATCH."}
{"prompt": "I need to understand why my FLOWROLL values are unexpectedly large.", "completion": "Check your PeriodCount. Large windows accumulate many periods, resulting in proportionally larger sums."}
{"prompt": "I need to implement one-to-many relationships with DIMMATCH.", "completion": "DIMMATCH supports one-to-many relationships. It distributes or aggregates values based on structural relationships between source and target."}
{"prompt": "I need to calculate a 4-week rolling total for weekly inventory tracking.", "completion": "If your model uses weekly periods, use `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 4, \"BACKWARD\")`."}
{"prompt": "I need to resolve DIMMATCH working in one direction but failing in reverse.", "completion": "Mapping relationships may be unidirectional. Verify relationships exist in both directions if bidirectional alignment is needed."}
{"prompt": "I need to handle missing periods in my FLOWROLL calculation.", "completion": "Missing periods within the time range prevent complete window formation, causing FLOWROLL to return blanks."}

{"prompt": "I need to prevent unexpected aggregations in my DIMMATCH calculations.", "completion": "Check the target dimension structure. Aggregation occurs when mapping to parent levels in the hierarchy."}
{"prompt": "I need to implement forecasting with FLOWROLL for budget planning.", "completion": "FLOWROLL doesn't forecast. It only aggregates existing data. Use FORWARD for leading indicators, not predictions."}
