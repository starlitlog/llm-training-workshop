{"prompt": "I'm curious - how would I go about calculating a trailing 3-month total?", "completion": "You'd use `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 3, \"BACKWARD\")` which gives you the sum of the current period plus the previous 2 periods."}
{"prompt": "I'm wondering what the Direction parameter actually controls in FLOWROLL?", "completion": "It controls which way the window looks: \"BACKWARD\" looks at past periods (trailing), \"FORWARD\" looks at future periods (leading)."}
{"prompt": "I'd like to learn how DIMMATCH works. Could you show me a basic example?", "completion": "Sure! The basic form is `DIMMATCH(SourceLineItem, TargetDimension)`, which aligns your source data to match the target dimension's structure."}
{"prompt": "I'm getting all zeros from FLOWROLL. What might be causing that?", "completion": "Two common causes: either your input LineItem doesn't have values, or your PeriodCount is larger than the available time range."}
{"prompt": "I'm curious about what happens when PeriodCount is set to 1?", "completion": "With PeriodCount=1, the window only includes the current period, so FLOWROLL just returns the original values unchanged."}
{"prompt": "I'm trying to figure out how to map sales data to a different product hierarchy.", "completion": "You'd use `DIMMATCH(Sales, TargetProductList)`, but make sure you have mapping relationships defined between the source and target hierarchies."}
{"prompt": "I noticed FLOWROLL gives blanks for my first 5 periods. Is that normal?", "completion": "Yes, that's expected. Those periods don't have enough historical data to form complete windows. With PeriodCount=6, the first 5 periods will be blank."}
{"prompt": "I'm wondering if DIMMATCH always needs a mapping table?", "completion": "Not necessarily. If your source and target dimensions already have direct structural compatibility through parent-child relationships, you might not need one."}
{"prompt": "I'd like to know how to write a formula for a 12-period forward sum.", "completion": "You'd write `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 12, \"FORWARD\")`, which sums the current period plus the next 11 periods."}
{"prompt": "I'm curious why DIMMATCH keeps failing when I try to align revenue with customers.", "completion": "It's likely a structural compatibility issue. Check whether mapping relationships exist between your source and target hierarchies."}
{"prompt": "I'm trying to troubleshoot FLOWROLL - where should I start looking?", "completion": "Start by checking that your periods are in chronological order, then verify that PeriodCount matches the window size you want."}
{"prompt": "I'm wondering what FLOWROLL does when it can't build a complete window?", "completion": "It returns blanks whenever there aren't enough periods available at the beginning or end of your time range."}
{"prompt": "I'm curious - can I use DIMMATCH with time dimensions?", "completion": "No, DIMMATCH is designed for structural list dimensions only, not time periods."}
{"prompt": "I'd like to know how to calculate a 6-month trailing average.", "completion": "Use `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 6, \"BACKWARD\") / 6` - the FLOWROLL gives you the sum, and dividing by 6 gives you the average."}
{"prompt": "I'm getting dimension errors from DIMMATCH. What could be wrong?", "completion": "Usually it means your source and target dimensions aren't properly defined or don't have compatible structures or mappings."}
{"prompt": "I'm wondering what happens if my periods aren't in chronological order?", "completion": "FLOWROLL won't work correctly because it needs chronological ordering to build valid rolling windows."}
{"prompt": "I'm curious about how to map product SKUs to regions using DIMMATCH.", "completion": "You'd create a mapping table linking SKUs to regions, then use `DIMMATCH(SKUData, RegionList)` to do the alignment."}
{"prompt": "I'm wondering if FLOWROLL has problems with negative numbers?", "completion": "Not at all. FLOWROLL includes negative values in the rolling sum just like it does with positive values."}
{"prompt": "I noticed DIMMATCH only returns partial results. What might cause that?", "completion": "Some of your source items probably don't have mapping relationships defined. You'll need to add complete mappings for all leaf-level members."}
{"prompt": "I'm curious what the minimum PeriodCount value is?", "completion": "The minimum is 1, though anything less than 2 doesn't really create a meaningful rolling window."}
{"prompt": "I'd like to understand how to debug DIMMATCH alignment issues.", "completion": "Start by verifying structural compatibility, then check that your mapping tables are complete and all required relationships are defined."}
{"prompt": "I'm noticing sudden jumps in my FLOWROLL results. What causes that?", "completion": "Those jumps happen when large values enter or leave the rolling window. You might want to check your input data for spikes or gaps."}
{"prompt": "I'm wondering if FLOWROLL works with weekly data?", "completion": "Absolutely! FLOWROLL works with any sequential time periods - weeks, months, quarters, or even custom calendars."}
{"prompt": "I'm curious what DIMMATCH does when dimensions don't match?", "completion": "It returns blanks or errors for items that don't have structural compatibility or mapping relationships."}
{"prompt": "I'd like to know how to get quarter-to-date totals with FLOWROLL.", "completion": "Use `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 3, \"BACKWARD\")` to get quarterly totals that align to each month within the quarter."}
{"prompt": "I'm wondering why DIMMATCH seems to skip some hierarchy levels?", "completion": "DIMMATCH needs explicit mappings at all levels. You'll need to add parent-child relationships for those missing levels."}
{"prompt": "I'm trying to understand the difference between BACKWARD and FORWARD direction.", "completion": "BACKWARD creates trailing windows using historical data, while FORWARD creates leading windows using future data."}
{"prompt": "I'm curious if DIMMATCH can work across different models?", "completion": "No, DIMMATCH works within a single model using its internal structural relationships and mappings."}
{"prompt": "I noticed FLOWROLL gives different results after I reordered periods. Why is that?", "completion": "Period order determines window composition. You need to maintain chronological ordering for accurate rolling calculations."}
{"prompt": "I'm wondering how filtering works with DIMMATCH?", "completion": "You should apply DIMMATCH first, then filter. DIMMATCH operates on the full dimensional structure before filtering happens."}
{"prompt": "I'm curious if there's a maximum PeriodCount limit?", "completion": "There's no hard limit, but if PeriodCount exceeds your available periods, you'll just get blanks for all windows."}
{"prompt": "I'm noticing DIMMATCH duplicates values across members. Is that expected?", "completion": "Yes, that happens when the target dimension has child nodes. DIMMATCH expands values to all applicable members in the target structure."}
{"prompt": "I'd like to know how to calculate year-over-year rolling sums.", "completion": "Use `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 12, \"BACKWARD\")` to get trailing 12-month totals for year-over-year comparisons."}
{"prompt": "I'm wondering if FLOWROLL works with fiscal calendars?", "completion": "Yes, as long as your fiscal periods are properly sequenced in chronological order within the model."}
{"prompt": "I noticed DIMMATCH returns blanks for items I just added. What should I do?", "completion": "You need to add mapping entries for those new items to include them in the dimensional alignment."}
{"prompt": "I'm curious what happens at the edges of my time range with FLOWROLL?", "completion": "FLOWROLL returns blanks when the windows would extend beyond your available periods at either the start or end."}
{"prompt": "I'm wondering if I can combine FLOWROLL and DIMMATCH together?", "completion": "Yes! Use `DIMMATCH(FLOWROLL(LineItem, 6, \"BACKWARD\"), TargetDim)` - apply FLOWROLL first, then DIMMATCH."}
{"prompt": "I'm curious why my FLOWROLL values are so large?", "completion": "Check your PeriodCount. Large windows accumulate many periods, which naturally results in larger sums."}
{"prompt": "I'd like to know if DIMMATCH supports one-to-many relationships?", "completion": "Yes, it does. DIMMATCH will distribute or aggregate values based on the structural relationship between source and target."}
{"prompt": "I'm trying to figure out how to get a 4-week rolling total.", "completion": "If your model uses weekly periods, use `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 4, \"BACKWARD\")`."}
{"prompt": "I noticed DIMMATCH works one way but fails in reverse. What could cause that?", "completion": "Your mapping relationships might be unidirectional. Check if relationships are defined in both directions."}
{"prompt": "I'm wondering what happens when FLOWROLL encounters missing periods?", "completion": "Missing periods within the time range prevent complete window formation, so FLOWROLL returns blanks."}
{"prompt": "I'm curious how to align measures with different dimensions?", "completion": "Use `DIMMATCH(SourceMeasure, CommonDimension)` to project both measures onto a shared dimensional structure."}
{"prompt": "I'd like to know if FLOWROLL can smooth volatile data?", "completion": "Yes! Larger PeriodCount values create smoother results by averaging out short-term fluctuations."}
{"prompt": "I'm wondering why DIMMATCH stopped working after I added new hierarchy members?", "completion": "New members need mapping relationships. Add them to your mapping tables and alignment should work again."}
{"prompt": "I'm curious how to calculate rolling sums for each region separately?", "completion": "Use `FLOWROLL(RegionalData, 3, \"BACKWARD\")` - it automatically calculates independent rolling sums for each region."}
{"prompt": "I'm still a bit confused about when to use FORWARD vs BACKWARD.", "completion": "Use BACKWARD for trailing windows (historical analysis) and FORWARD for leading windows (looking at future periods)."}
{"prompt": "I'm noticing DIMMATCH produces unexpected aggregations. What should I check?", "completion": "Look at your target dimension structure. Aggregation happens when you're mapping to parent levels in the hierarchy."}
{"prompt": "I'm wondering if FLOWROLL can be used for forecasting?", "completion": "No, FLOWROLL only aggregates existing data. You can use FORWARD direction for leading indicators, but it won't forecast or predict."}
