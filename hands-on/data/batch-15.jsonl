{"prompt": "I've tried everything but FLOWROLL still won't give me the trailing totals I need.", "completion": "Try `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 3, \"BACKWARD\")` for a trailing 3-period sum. Make sure your periods are in order and PeriodCount isn't too large."}
{"prompt": "This Direction parameter is driving me crazy. What does it even do?", "completion": "Direction controls window orientation: \"BACKWARD\" gives you trailing windows (past data), \"FORWARD\" gives you leading windows (future data)."}
{"prompt": "I've been staring at DIMMATCH for an hour. Can someone just show me a working example?", "completion": "Here's the basic syntax: `DIMMATCH(SourceLineItem, TargetDimension)`. It aligns your source values to the target dimension structure."}
{"prompt": "FLOWROLL returns nothing but zeros no matter what I do. This is frustrating.", "completion": "Check two things: (1) Does your input LineItem have non-zero values? (2) Is your PeriodCount smaller than the available time range?"}
{"prompt": "Setting PeriodCount to 1 doesn't seem to do anything useful. What's the point?", "completion": "With PeriodCount=1, each window is just the single current period, so FLOWROLL simply returns the original values."}
{"prompt": "I need to map sales to another hierarchy but nothing is working.", "completion": "Use `DIMMATCH(Sales, TargetProductList)` but you must have mapping relationships defined between source and target hierarchies."}
{"prompt": "Why on earth are the first 5 periods always blank in FLOWROLL?", "completion": "Because those periods don't have enough prior history. If you're using PeriodCount=6, the first 5 periods can't form complete windows."}
{"prompt": "Does DIMMATCH absolutely require a mapping table? I don't have one.", "completion": "Only if there's no direct structural compatibility. If your dimensions have parent-child relationships already, you might not need explicit mappings."}
{"prompt": "I keep trying to write a forward-looking 12-period sum but it's not working.", "completion": "Use this syntax: `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 12, \"FORWARD\")`. It sums the current period plus the next 11."}
{"prompt": "DIMMATCH fails every single time I try to align revenue with customers.", "completion": "Your dimensions aren't structurally compatible. Check that you have mapping relationships defined between the source and target hierarchies."}
{"prompt": "FLOWROLL keeps giving me unexpected results and I don't know where to start.", "completion": "First, verify periods are chronologically ordered. Second, confirm PeriodCount matches your intended window size."}
{"prompt": "What's FLOWROLL supposed to return when it can't build a window? Because I'm getting blanks.", "completion": "That's correct behavior. FLOWROLL returns blanks when there aren't enough periods at the start or end of the time range to form complete windows."}
{"prompt": "I tried using DIMMATCH on time periods and it completely failed.", "completion": "That's expected. DIMMATCH is designed for structural list dimensions only, not time periods."}
{"prompt": "How am I supposed to calculate a trailing 6-month average? Nothing I try works.", "completion": "Use `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 6, \"BACKWARD\") / 6`. The FLOWROLL gives you the sum, then divide by 6 for the average."}
{"prompt": "DIMMATCH won't stop throwing dimension errors at me. What am I doing wrong?", "completion": "Both dimensions must be properly defined with compatible structures or mappings. Check that source and target are correctly set up."}
{"prompt": "My periods are out of order and FLOWROLL is giving garbage results.", "completion": "That's why. FLOWROLL requires chronological ordering. Reorder your periods chronologically and the rolling windows will work correctly."}
{"prompt": "I have no idea how to map product SKUs to regions with DIMMATCH.", "completion": "First create a mapping table linking SKUs to regions, then use `DIMMATCH(SKUData, RegionList)` to align the values."}
{"prompt": "Does FLOWROLL break when I use negative numbers? Because mine aren't working.", "completion": "No, FLOWROLL handles negative values fine. They're included in rolling sums just like positive values."}
{"prompt": "DIMMATCH only gives me partial results instead of the full alignment I need.", "completion": "Some source items probably lack mapping relationships. You need to add complete mappings for all leaf-level members."}
{"prompt": "What's the absolute minimum PeriodCount I can use without breaking things?", "completion": "PeriodCount must be at least 1, but anything below 2 won't create meaningful rolling windows."}
{"prompt": "I'm completely stuck debugging DIMMATCH alignment failures.", "completion": "Verify structural compatibility first, then check mapping tables for completeness, and ensure all required relationships exist."}
{"prompt": "These sudden jumps in FLOWROLL results are ruining my analysis.", "completion": "Those jumps happen when large values enter or leave the rolling window. Check your input data for spikes or gaps."}
{"prompt": "I assumed FLOWROLL only worked with monthly data but I need weekly.", "completion": "FLOWROLL works with any sequential time periods - weeks, months, quarters, or even custom calendars."}
{"prompt": "What's DIMMATCH supposed to do when dimensions don't match? Mine just errors out.", "completion": "It returns blanks or errors for items without structural compatibility or mapping relationships. That's expected behavior."}
{"prompt": "I need quarter-to-date totals but can't figure out how to get them from FLOWROLL.", "completion": "Use `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 3, \"BACKWARD\")` to get quarterly totals aligned to each month within the quarter."}
{"prompt": "DIMMATCH is completely ignoring certain hierarchy levels and I don't know why.", "completion": "DIMMATCH requires explicit mappings at all levels. Add the parent-child relationships for those missing levels."}
{"prompt": "I keep mixing up BACKWARD and FORWARD. What's the actual difference?", "completion": "BACKWARD creates trailing windows (historical data), FORWARD creates leading windows (future data)."}
{"prompt": "I thought DIMMATCH could work across models but it's failing.", "completion": "DIMMATCH can't cross model boundaries. It only works within a single model using internal relationships and mappings."}
{"prompt": "I reordered some periods and now FLOWROLL gives completely different numbers.", "completion": "Period order determines window composition. You must maintain chronological ordering for correct rolling calculations."}
{"prompt": "How does filtering affect DIMMATCH? Because my filtered results look wrong.", "completion": "Apply DIMMATCH first, then filter. DIMMATCH operates on the full structure before filtering takes effect."}
{"prompt": "Is there some maximum PeriodCount limit I'm hitting?", "completion": "No hard limit exists, but if PeriodCount exceeds available periods, you'll get blanks for all windows."}
{"prompt": "Why is DIMMATCH duplicating my values everywhere?", "completion": "The target dimension has child nodes, so DIMMATCH expands values to all applicable members in the target structure."}
{"prompt": "I need year-over-year rolling totals but don't know the right formula.", "completion": "Use `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 12, \"BACKWARD\")` to get trailing 12-month sums for year-over-year comparison."}
{"prompt": "I'm using a fiscal calendar and FLOWROLL isn't working at all.", "completion": "FLOWROLL works with fiscal calendars if periods are properly sequenced in chronological order within the model."}
{"prompt": "DIMMATCH completely ignores items I just added to my hierarchy.", "completion": "Add mapping entries for the new items to include them in dimensional alignment."}
{"prompt": "What's happening at the edges of my time range? FLOWROLL keeps returning blanks.", "completion": "FLOWROLL returns blanks when windows extend beyond available periods at the start or end of the range."}
{"prompt": "Can I even combine FLOWROLL and DIMMATCH or will that break everything?", "completion": "Yes, you can nest them: `DIMMATCH(FLOWROLL(LineItem, 6, \"BACKWARD\"), TargetDim)`. Apply FLOWROLL first, then DIMMATCH."}
{"prompt": "My FLOWROLL values are absurdly large. Something must be wrong.", "completion": "Check your PeriodCount. Large windows accumulate many periods, naturally resulting in large sums."}
{"prompt": "Does DIMMATCH even support one-to-many relationships or is that impossible?", "completion": "Yes, it supports them. DIMMATCH distributes or aggregates values based on the structural relationship between source and target."}
{"prompt": "I need a 4-week rolling total but the formula I'm using doesn't work.", "completion": "If your model uses weekly periods, use `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 4, \"BACKWARD\")`."}
{"prompt": "DIMMATCH works perfectly in one direction but completely fails in reverse.", "completion": "Mapping relationships might be unidirectional. Verify that relationships exist in both directions if you need bidirectional alignment."}
{"prompt": "FLOWROLL breaks whenever there's a gap in my data.", "completion": "Missing periods within the time range prevent complete window formation, causing FLOWROLL to return blanks."}
{"prompt": "How am I supposed to align two measures with completely different dimensions?", "completion": "Use `DIMMATCH(SourceMeasure, CommonDimension)` to project both measures onto a shared dimensional structure."}
{"prompt": "Can FLOWROLL actually smooth my volatile data or is that just wishful thinking?", "completion": "Yes! Larger PeriodCount values create smoother results by averaging out short-term fluctuations."}
{"prompt": "DIMMATCH was working fine until I added new hierarchy members and now it's broken.", "completion": "New members need mapping relationships. Add them to your mapping tables to restore alignment."}
{"prompt": "How do I calculate rolling sums separately for each region without them interfering?", "completion": "Use `FLOWROLL(RegionalData, 3, \"BACKWARD\")` - it automatically computes independent rolling sums for each region."}
{"prompt": "I still don't understand when to use FORWARD versus BACKWARD.", "completion": "BACKWARD for trailing windows (historical analysis), FORWARD for leading windows (looking at future periods)."}
{"prompt": "DIMMATCH is producing aggregations I didn't ask for.", "completion": "Check the target dimension structure. Aggregation automatically occurs when mapping to parent levels in the hierarchy."}
