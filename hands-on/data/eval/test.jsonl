{"prompt": "What happens if I change Direction from BACKWARD to FORWARD?", "completion": "The window flips from trailing to leading, computing future sums instead of historical sums."}
{"prompt": "Can DIMMATCH align data across different models?", "completion": "Not directly. DIMMATCH works within a single model using internal structural relationships and mappings."}
{"prompt": "FLOWROLL gives different results after reordering periods. Why?", "completion": "Period order determines window composition. Always maintain chronological ordering for correct rolling calculations."}
{"prompt": "How do I use DIMMATCH with filtered data?", "completion": "Apply DIMMATCH first, then filter. DIMMATCH operates on full dimensional structure before filtering takes effect."}

{"prompt": "Why are my FLOWROLL values so large?", "completion": "Check your PeriodCount. Large windows accumulate many periods, resulting in large sums."}
{"prompt": "Can DIMMATCH handle one-to-many relationships?", "completion": "Yes. DIMMATCH distributes or aggregates values based on the structural relationship between source and target."}
{"prompt": "How do I get a 4-week rolling total?", "completion": "Use `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 4, \"BACKWARD\")` if your model uses weekly periods."}
{"prompt": "DIMMATCH works in one direction but not the reverse. Why?", "completion": "Mapping relationships may be unidirectional. Verify that relationships exist in both directions if needed."}
{"prompt": "What happens when FLOWROLL encounters missing periods?", "completion": "Missing periods within the time range prevent complete windows, causing FLOWROLL to return blanks."}
{"prompt": "How do I align measures from different dimensionalities?", "completion": "Use `DIMMATCH(SourceMeasure, CommonDimension)` to project both measures onto a shared dimensional structure."}
{"prompt": "Can FLOWROLL smooth volatile data?", "completion": "Yes. Larger PeriodCount values create smoother results by averaging out short-term fluctuations."}

{"prompt": "DIMMATCH produces unexpected aggregations. What should I check?", "completion": "Verify the target dimension structure. Aggregation occurs when mapping to parent levels in the hierarchy."}
{"prompt": "Can I use FLOWROLL for forecasting?", "completion": "No. FLOWROLL only aggregates existing data. Use FORWARD direction for leading indicators, not predictions."}
{"prompt": "How do I fix DIMMATCH errors with composite lists?", "completion": "Ensure all component dimensions in the composite list have compatible mappings to the target dimension."}
{"prompt": "What causes FLOWROLL to return the same value for multiple periods?", "completion": "If input data is constant and PeriodCount creates overlapping windows, results will appear stable or identical."}
{"prompt": "Can DIMMATCH align based on member names?", "completion": "No. DIMMATCH uses internal IDs and structural relationships, not member names or labels."}
{"prompt": "How do I get a 13-week rolling average?", "completion": "Use `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 13, \"BACKWARD\") / 13` to compute the trailing 13-week average."}
{"prompt": "Why does FLOWROLL produce negative totals?", "completion": "Your input data contains negative values. FLOWROLL includes all values in the rolling sum, positive or negative."}
{"prompt": "What does DIMMATCH do with unmapped items?", "completion": "Unmapped items return blanks or are excluded from the alignment. Add mappings to include them."}
{"prompt": "How do I calculate month-to-date using FLOWROLL?", "completion": "FLOWROLL doesn't directly support month-to-date. Use alternative aggregation methods for within-period totals."}

{"prompt": "How do I map customers to territories with DIMMATCH?", "completion": "Create a customer-to-territory mapping, then use `DIMMATCH(CustomerData, TerritoryList)` to align values."}
{"prompt": "Can FLOWROLL cross fiscal year boundaries?", "completion": "Yes, if periods are chronologically continuous across year boundaries."}
{"prompt": "Why does DIMMATCH slow down with large hierarchies?", "completion": "Deep or wide hierarchies require more structural processing. Pre-aggregate or simplify the hierarchy where possible."}

{"prompt": "What happens when FLOWROLL windows overlap?", "completion": "That's normal behavior. Each period gets its own window based on PeriodCount and Direction."}
{"prompt": "Can DIMMATCH work with alternate hierarchies?", "completion": "Yes, if alternate paths are defined with proper mapping relationships in the model."}
{"prompt": "How do I get a trailing 10-period average?", "completion": "Use `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 10, \"BACKWARD\") / 10` to compute the 10-period trailing average."}
{"prompt": "Why does FLOWROLL return blanks at year-end?", "completion": "FORWARD direction requires future periods. Year-end has no subsequent periods, causing blanks."}
{"prompt": "What does DIMMATCH do with inactive members?", "completion": "Inactive members are typically excluded unless explicitly included in active selection or mappings."}

{"prompt": "Why does FLOWROLL produce lower values after data corrections?", "completion": "Corrected values change the window composition. FLOWROLL recalculates based on the updated input data."}
{"prompt": "What happens if DIMMATCH target dimension changes?", "completion": "DIMMATCH recalculates alignment based on the new target structure and mapping relationships."}
{"prompt": "Can FLOWROLL work with sparse data?", "completion": "Yes, but missing periods within the range will prevent complete windows, causing blanks."}
{"prompt": "How do I fix DIMMATCH when alignment looks correct but values are wrong?", "completion": "DIMMATCH only handles structure. Verify the source formula and input data are correct."}
{"prompt": "What's the behavior of FLOWROLL with PeriodCount equal to total periods?", "completion": "Only the final period (BACKWARD) or first period (FORWARD) will have a complete window; others will be blank."}
