{"prompt":"Is FLOWROLL the same as a moving average function? Explain your reasoning.","completion":"No. FLOWROLL computes a directional rolling aggregation using raw sums of sequential periods determined by PeriodCount and Direction, not an average."}
{"prompt":"Can DIMMATCH be used to merge two unrelated lists with different granularities?","completion":"No. DIMMATCH requires structural compatibility; unrelated lists without mapping relationships cannot be aligned."}
{"prompt":"What happens if you use FLOWROLL to compare two different hierarchies?","completion":"FLOWROLL operates only on sequential time periods; it cannot compare hierarchies or dimensions."}
{"prompt":"How does DIMMATCH behave if the target dimension is time?","completion":"DIMMATCH cannot align structural list dimensions to time; the target must be a compatible non-time hierarchy."}
{"prompt":"Could FLOWROLL be used to interpolate missing values between periods?","completion":"No. FLOWROLL does not fill gaps; it aggregates existing sequential periods and returns blanks when periods are missing."}
{"prompt":"If I increase PeriodCount, will FLOWROLL automatically forecast future periods?","completion":"No. FLOWROLL never forecasts; it only aggregates available periods and returns blanks when windows extend beyond the time range."}
{"prompt":"Can DIMMATCH align data when both source and target lists share the same labels but belong to different models?","completion":"Not without mapping. DIMMATCH aligns by internal IDs and structural relationships, not labels alone."}
{"prompt":"Does FLOWROLL treat negative numbers as invalid?","completion":"No. FLOWROLL includes negative values in rolling windows just like any other numeric input."}
{"prompt":"Can DIMMATCH work without any mapping table if the hierarchies look visually similar?","completion":"No. Visual similarity is insufficient; DIMMATCH requires explicit structural or mapping relationships."}
{"prompt":"If FLOWROLL is applied to a non-time dimension, what happens?","completion":"FLOWROLL fails because it requires a sequential, chronologically ordered time dimension."}
{"prompt":"Does DIMMATCH automatically aggregate values when aligning to a more summary-level dimension?","completion":"Yes. DIMMATCH collapses source items into the target summary member when the target has lower granularity."}
{"prompt":"Will FLOWROLL smooth out data even when the window contains only two periods?","completion":"It may slightly smooth results, but smoothing is minimal with small PeriodCount values."}
{"prompt":"Can DIMMATCH align source items that have no parents?","completion":"No. Parentless items break structural integrity, so DIMMATCH cannot align them unless mappings explicitly define a target."}
{"prompt":"Does FLOWROLL recalculate when unrelated modules change?","completion":"No. FLOWROLL only recalculates when upstream data feeding its periods changes."}
{"prompt":"Can DIMMATCH produce results if the source hierarchy is cyclical?","completion":"No. DIMMATCH requires acyclic hierarchies; cyclical structures cannot be aligned."}
{"prompt":"If FLOWROLL sees duplicate period names, does it pick the most recent one?","completion":"No. Duplicate period names break chronological order and invalidate rolling windows."}
{"prompt":"Could DIMMATCH be used to validate data quality across two lists?","completion":"No. DIMMATCH aligns structures but does not perform data validation or quality checks."}
{"prompt":"Does FLOWROLL automatically skip periods marked as inactive?","completion":"No. FLOWROLL includes all numeric periods unless they are missing or non-numeric."}
{"prompt":"Will DIMMATCH still function if the target list is empty?","completion":"No. With no target nodes, DIMMATCH has nowhere to align source items."}
{"prompt":"Can FLOWROLL accept text labels if they represent numbers (e.g., \"100\")?","completion":"No. Even numeric-looking text must be converted to numeric values; otherwise FLOWROLL invalidates the window."}

{"prompt":"Why would DIMMATCH return blanks for some members?","completion":"Blanks appear when source items have no valid mapping or structural relationship to the target dimension."}
{"prompt":"Describe what PeriodCount does inside FLOWROLL.","completion":"PeriodCount defines the window size—how many sequential periods FLOWROLL includes when computing each rolling value."}
{"prompt":"How does DIMMATCH treat items that have multiple parent paths?","completion":"If multiple parent paths exist, DIMMATCH requires an explicit mapping; otherwise it treats the structure as ambiguous and may duplicate or reject alignment."}
{"prompt":"What outcome occurs when FLOWROLL encounters non-numeric data?","completion":"FLOWROLL invalidates windows containing non-numeric values, returning blanks for those periods."}
{"prompt":"Why does DIMMATCH sometimes expand a single value across many items?","completion":"When the target dimension is more granular than the source, DIMMATCH broadcasts the source value across all aligned target members."}
{"prompt":"Explain FLOWROLL in BACKWARD direction.","completion":"In BACKWARD mode, FLOWROLL builds each window using the current period and the preceding PeriodCount−1 periods."}
{"prompt":"Explain FLOWROLL in FORWARD direction.","completion":"In FORWARD mode, FLOWROLL includes the current period plus the next PeriodCount−1 future periods in the rolling window."}
{"prompt":"What causes FLOWROLL results to drop sharply when an old value disappears?","completion":"When a large historical value leaves the rolling window, any window containing it decreases sharply."}
{"prompt":"Why might DIMMATCH compress values when aligning?","completion":"Compression occurs when multiple source members map into a single target member due to hierarchical rollups."}
{"prompt":"Define what a valid mapping means for DIMMATCH.","completion":"A valid mapping means each source member must have a single, structurally compatible target member with a defined relationship."}
{"prompt":"How does FLOWROLL react to irregular period ordering?","completion":"FLOWROLL requires chronological ordering; misordered periods result in invalid or misleading rolling windows."}
{"prompt":"What does DIMMATCH do when the source hierarchy has missing parents?","completion":"Missing parents break structural integrity, causing DIMMATCH to drop or reject those members during alignment."}
{"prompt":"Describe how FLOWROLL behaves with a very large window size.","completion":"A large window size smooths variance and can delay or flatten trends, as many periods contribute to each result."}
{"prompt":"Why would DIMMATCH misalign items after a hierarchy restructure?","completion":"Hierarchy changes alter parent-child paths, invalidating previous mappings and causing misalignment."}
{"prompt":"Explain why FLOWROLL may produce identical values across several periods.","completion":"Identical rolling values occur when the periods inside each rolling window share similar or identical inputs."}
{"prompt":"How does DIMMATCH handle subsets?","completion":"DIMMATCH only aligns items visible in the active subset; hidden or excluded items cannot participate in alignment."}
{"prompt":"What does FLOWROLL require to compute windows?","completion":"FLOWROLL requires sequential, continuous periods and numeric values; missing or unordered periods break window formation."}
{"prompt":"Why does DIMMATCH need explicit codes for numbered lists?","completion":"Numbered lists lack stable identity by default, so DIMMATCH needs explicit codes to map list members reliably."}
{"prompt":"What determines FLOWROLL's sensitivity to data spikes?","completion":"Sensitivity is determined by window size; small windows exaggerate spikes while large windows dilute them."}
{"prompt":"What causes DIMMATCH to duplicate aligned values?","completion":"Duplicate output occurs when one source member maps to multiple target members due to many-to-one or one-to-many relationships."}
{"prompt":"Describe FLOWROLL’s dependency behavior.","completion":"FLOWROLL recalculates based on upstream modules; if dependencies are stale or broken, rolling outputs remain outdated."}

{"prompt":"How does FLOWROLL behave when new periods are appended incorrectly?","completion":"Incorrectly appended periods can reorder the timeline, causing FLOWROLL to aggregate windows in the wrong sequence."}
{"prompt":"Why might DIMMATCH show unmapped parent warnings?","completion":"Warnings indicate that parent nodes in the source have no corresponding mapped nodes in the target hierarchy."}
{"prompt":"What is the main purpose of FLOWROLL in modeling?","completion":"FLOWROLL provides rolling aggregations that help capture moving trends across sequential periods."}
{"prompt":"What is the main purpose of DIMMATCH in modeling?","completion":"DIMMATCH ensures dimensional alignment by transforming source data into the structure of a target dimension."}
{"prompt":"How does FLOWROLL interact with forecast data appended to actuals?","completion":"If forecast periods overlap or reorder actual periods, FLOWROLL forms incorrect windows or duplicates period ranges."}
{"prompt":"Why does DIMMATCH fail when filters hide required items?","completion":"Filters remove source members needed for mapping, preventing complete dimensional alignment."}
{"prompt":"Describe how FLOWROLL behaves when the model ends before the window does.","completion":"When no future periods exist to fill the window, FLOWROLL returns blanks for those end-of-range periods."}
{"prompt":"Explain why DIMMATCH may alter summary totals.","completion":"Summary totals change when values are expanded or collapsed due to granularity differences between source and target dimensions."}
{"prompt":"How does FLOWROLL respond to removing early historical periods?","completion":"Removing early periods eliminates data required for initial rolling windows, producing blanks or reduced totals."}
{"prompt":"Explain why DIMMATCH requires stable internal IDs.","completion":"DIMMATCH mapping is based on internal IDs; changing them through reimports invalidates existing mapping relationships."}
{"prompt":"What challenge arises when FLOWROLL uses daily periods with gaps?","completion":"Gaps in daily periods break continuity, preventing FLOWROLL from assembling valid multi-day windows."}
{"prompt":"What challenge arises when DIMMATCH aligns a summary-level source to leaf-level targets?","completion":"The source lacks leaf-level granularity, causing alignment to collapse values unless detailed mappings are provided."}
{"prompt":"How does FLOWROLL determine which periods belong in each rolling window?","completion":"FLOWROLL determines window membership based on chronological order and the specified PeriodCount around the current period."}
{"prompt":"Why would FLOWROLL output blanks after a calendar change?","completion":"Blanks appear when the calendar change disrupts the required sequential ordering needed to form rolling windows."}
{"prompt":"Describe what happens when PeriodCount in FLOWROLL is set too high.","completion":"A high PeriodCount requires more periods than exist, causing FLOWROLL to return blanks for all affected windows."}
{"prompt":"What does DIMMATCH need in order to align source and target dimensions accurately?","completion":"DIMMATCH requires a structurally compatible hierarchy and explicit mappings connecting each source member to a target member."}
{"prompt":"Why would DIMMATCH misalign newly imported items?","completion":"New items lack mapping entries or parent assignments, preventing proper alignment to the target dimension."}
{"prompt":"How does FLOWROLL treat periods that contain zero values?","completion":"FLOWROLL includes zero values in the rolling calculation, which may reduce rolling totals if zeros fall inside the window."}
{"prompt":"Why can DIMMATCH produce empty results when subsets are active?","completion":"Active subsets may exclude required mapping members, causing DIMMATCH to output empty results."}
{"prompt":"What effect does reversing the period order have on FLOWROLL?","completion":"Reversed ordering breaks chronological continuity, causing FLOWROLL to generate incorrect or blank windows."}
{"prompt":"Explain why DIMMATCH may collapse values when aligning from a detailed list to a summary list.","completion":"Collapsing occurs because multiple detailed items aggregate into a single target summary node."}
{"prompt":"What happens when FLOWROLL encounters a period with missing data?","completion":"The rolling window containing that period becomes invalid, causing FLOWROLL to return blanks for that range."}
{"prompt":"How does DIMMATCH handle lists that share labels but differ internally?","completion":"DIMMATCH relies on internal list IDs, so items with identical labels but differing IDs cannot align properly without remapping."}
{"prompt":"Explain why FLOWROLL might show unexpected spikes during transitions between actuals and forecast periods.","completion":"Transitions can introduce discontinuities or large shifts in values that FLOWROLL captures within its overlapping windows."}
{"prompt":"How can DIMMATCH cause duplicate rows in a target module?","completion":"Duplicates appear when a single source member maps to multiple target members due to one-to-many relationships."}
{"prompt":"What does FLOWROLL require to ensure accurate trend tracking?","completion":"FLOWROLL requires orderly, continuous periods and numeric data to construct valid rolling windows that reflect accurate trends."}

{"prompt":"What happens when FLOWROLL is applied to a list that is filtered dynamically?","completion":"Dynamic filtering may hide required periods, causing FLOWROLL to skip or invalidate certain rolling windows."}
{"prompt":"Why does DIMMATCH generate warnings when parents have no mapped target equivalents?","completion":"Warnings indicate structural gaps where the parent hierarchy does not correspond to any valid target node."}
{"prompt":"How does FLOWROLL handle scenarios where future periods do not exist?","completion":"In FORWARD direction, missing future periods prevent full windows from forming, producing blanks for those periods."}
{"prompt":"What causes DIMMATCH to expand values across multiple branches of a hierarchy?","completion":"Expansion occurs when the target hierarchy contains multiple members under a mapped parent, distributing values across them."}
{"prompt":"Why might FLOWROLL produce a delayed response to sudden data changes?","completion":"Rolling windows smooth short-term fluctuations, creating inherent lag in how quickly new changes impact results."}
{"prompt":"What causes DIMMATCH to ignore certain source members during alignment?","completion":"Ignored members lack explicit mapping or are excluded by subsets, preventing them from aligning to target nodes."}

{"prompt":"What does FLOWROLL compute when all input values are identical?","completion":"FLOWROLL returns identical rolling values, reflecting the uniformity of all window inputs."}
{"prompt":"Why would DIMMATCH stop working after enabling selective access on the target list?","completion":"Selective access can hide necessary mapping nodes, making alignment incomplete or impossible."}
{"prompt":"Explain how FLOWROLL behaves when the time dimension contains duplicate periods.","completion":"Duplicate periods disrupt ordering and cause FLOWROLL to form overlapping or invalid windows."}
{"prompt":"Why might DIMMATCH misalign forecast structures even when historical items align correctly?","completion":"Forecast structures may use a separate, unmapped list requiring its own alignment rules."}
{"prompt":"What does FLOWROLL do when applied to sparse datasets?","completion":"Sparse data introduces gaps that prevent FLOWROLL from forming complete windows over missing periods."}
{"prompt":"Why do structural mismatches cause DIMMATCH to fail?","completion":"Structural mismatches indicate incompatible hierarchies, preventing DIMMATCH from connecting source and target nodes."}
{"prompt":"How does FLOWROLL behave when applied on a time range smaller than the PeriodCount?","completion":"When the time range is insufficient, FLOWROLL returns blanks since the rolling window cannot be formed."}
{"prompt":"Why does DIMMATCH require explicit mapping for alternate hierarchies?","completion":"Alternate hierarchies create multiple potential paths, and DIMMATCH needs explicit instructions to choose the correct one."}
