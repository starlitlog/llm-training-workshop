{"prompt": "Is FLOWROLL better than manually summing periods, or should I just do it myself?", "completion": "FLOWROLL is better because it automatically handles window construction for all periods. Manual summing would require separate formulas for each period position."}
{"prompt": "Should I use BACKWARD or FORWARD direction for sales trend analysis?", "completion": "Use BACKWARD for sales trends. It gives you trailing windows with historical data, which is what you need for trend analysis."}
{"prompt": "Is DIMMATCH the same as a lookup function, or does it work differently?", "completion": "DIMMATCH is different. Lookups retrieve single values, while DIMMATCH performs structural alignment across entire dimensions using mapping relationships."}
{"prompt": "Would FLOWROLL with PeriodCount=1 be faster than PeriodCount=12, or is performance the same?", "completion": "Performance is similar. The bottleneck isn't window size but rather the number of periods being calculated across your entire time range."}
{"prompt": "Should I use DIMMATCH or create a helper line item for dimensional alignment?", "completion": "Use DIMMATCH. Helper line items require manual maintenance and don't automatically update when hierarchies change."}
{"prompt": "Is it better to use large PeriodCount values or calculate averages separately?", "completion": "Depends on use case. Large PeriodCount for smoothing trends, but if you need actual averages, you must divide the FLOWROLL result explicitly."}
{"prompt": "Can FLOWROLL replace my existing moving average calculations, or are they different?", "completion": "FLOWROLL computes sums, not averages. To replace moving averages, use `FLOWROLL / PeriodCount` to convert the sum."}
{"prompt": "Should I apply filters before or after DIMMATCH alignment?", "completion": "After. DIMMATCH needs the complete dimensional structure to perform correct alignment, then you filter the results."}
{"prompt": "Is FLOWROLL more accurate with monthly or weekly periods?", "completion": "Accuracy is the same. FLOWROLL works identically regardless of period granularity as long as periods are sequential."}
{"prompt": "Would DIMMATCH work better with flat lists or hierarchical structures?", "completion": "Both work, but DIMMATCH shines with hierarchies. Flat lists with direct mapping relationships don't gain as much benefit."}
{"prompt": "Should I use multiple small FLOWROLL calculations or one large window?", "completion": "Depends on analysis needs. Multiple small windows show more detail and responsiveness, large windows provide better smoothing."}
{"prompt": "Is DIMMATCH faster than manual dimensional formulas?", "completion": "Usually yes, and DIMMATCH is definitely more maintainable. Manual formulas become complex and error-prone with deep hierarchies."}
{"prompt": "Can I use FLOWROLL for forecasting or should I use other methods?", "completion": "Use other methods. FLOWROLL aggregates existing data only. FORWARD direction shows future data but doesn't predict or forecast."}
{"prompt": "Should I use BACKWARD direction for all historical analysis?", "completion": "Yes, BACKWARD is correct for historical analysis as it creates trailing windows that look at past data."}
{"prompt": "Is it better to have many mapping tables or one comprehensive table for DIMMATCH?", "completion": "One comprehensive table per dimension pair is better. Multiple tables create maintenance overhead and potential inconsistencies."}
{"prompt": "Would FLOWROLL with overlapping windows cause double-counting issues?", "completion": "No. Each period calculates its own independent window. Overlapping is expected behavior, not double-counting."}
{"prompt": "Should I use DIMMATCH for time alignment or is there a better function?", "completion": "Don't use DIMMATCH for time. It doesn't support time dimensions. Use time-specific functions for temporal operations."}
{"prompt": "Is PeriodCount=3 better than PeriodCount=4 for quarterly analysis?", "completion": "Use PeriodCount=3 for quarters if you have monthly periods. PeriodCount=4 would give you four months, which isn't a quarter."}
{"prompt": "Can FLOWROLL handle both positive and negative values or should I separate them?", "completion": "Keep them together. FLOWROLL correctly handles mixed positive and negative values in the same rolling window."}
{"prompt": "Should I create separate FLOWROLL formulas for each region or one formula for all?", "completion": "One formula for all. FLOWROLL automatically maintains dimensional context and calculates independent windows per region."}
{"prompt": "Is DIMMATCH alignment bidirectional or does direction matter?", "completion": "Direction matters. DIMMATCH maps from source to target. Reverse direction requires mappings defined in both directions."}
{"prompt": "Would smaller PeriodCount values give more recent data emphasis?", "completion": "Yes. Smaller windows are more responsive to recent changes, larger windows emphasize longer-term trends over recent data."}
{"prompt": "Should I use FLOWROLL or cumulative sum for year-to-date calculations?", "completion": "Depends on need. FLOWROLL gives rolling windows, cumulative sum gives period-start-to-current totals. Different use cases."}
{"prompt": "Is it better to fix data before FLOWROLL or let FLOWROLL handle gaps?", "completion": "Fix gaps first. FLOWROLL returns blanks for incomplete windows, it won't interpolate or fill missing data."}
{"prompt": "Can DIMMATCH replace all my cross-dimensional formulas?", "completion": "Most of them. DIMMATCH handles structural alignment elegantly, but some complex calculations may still need custom formulas."}
{"prompt": "Should I use FLOWROLL on derived values or source data?", "completion": "Both work fine. FLOWROLL doesn't care whether input is source data or calculated values, just that it's numeric."}
{"prompt": "Is BACKWARD direction slower than FORWARD or same performance?", "completion": "Same performance. Direction only affects which periods are included in windows, not computational complexity."}
{"prompt": "Would DIMMATCH work better with complete or partial mapping tables?", "completion": "Complete tables. Partial mappings return blanks for unmapped items, reducing alignment coverage and usefulness."}
{"prompt": "Should I use FLOWROLL for data validation or just for analysis?", "completion": "Primarily for analysis. FLOWROLL aggregates data but doesn't validate quality, consistency, or correctness."}
{"prompt": "Is PeriodCount=12 appropriate for monthly year-over-year or should I use something else?", "completion": "PeriodCount=12 is correct for year-over-year with monthly periods. Gives you trailing 12-month totals."}
{"prompt": "Can FLOWROLL replace my existing trend calculations or are they incompatible?", "completion": "Likely compatible. FLOWROLL provides rolling sums that are foundation for most trend calculations, though you may need additional math."}
{"prompt": "Should I apply DIMMATCH at the leaf level or parent level?", "completion": "Depends on granularity needed. Leaf level preserves detail, parent level provides aggregation. DIMMATCH handles both."}
{"prompt": "Is it worth using FLOWROLL for just 2 periods or too simple?", "completion": "PeriodCount=2 works but provides minimal smoothing. Consider whether simple current+previous addition is sufficient without FLOWROLL."}
{"prompt": "Would DIMMATCH improve performance compared to nested IF statements?", "completion": "Yes. DIMMATCH is optimized for dimensional operations while nested IFs become exponentially slower with hierarchy depth."}
{"prompt": "Should I use FLOWROLL on filtered data or filter after FLOWROLL?", "completion": "Either works. FLOWROLL operates on whatever data you provide, filtered or not. Choose based on what you want to aggregate."}
{"prompt": "Is DIMMATCH necessary for simple one-to-one mappings or overkill?", "completion": "Might be overkill for true one-to-one. But DIMMATCH provides maintainability benefits even in simple cases."}
{"prompt": "Can I use FLOWROLL for real-time data or is it batch-only?", "completion": "FLOWROLL recalculates whenever input changes, so it works with real-time data as long as periods update in order."}
{"prompt": "Should I use separate mapping tables per hierarchy level or one combined table?", "completion": "One combined table per dimension pair is cleaner. Separate tables by level creates unnecessary complexity."}
{"prompt": "Is FLOWROLL with large windows less accurate than small windows?", "completion": "Not less accurate, just different purpose. Large windows smooth data, small windows preserve detail. Both are accurate for their use case."}
{"prompt": "Would DIMMATCH conflict with existing dimensional formulas or can they coexist?", "completion": "They coexist fine. DIMMATCH is just another formula function. It can be combined with other dimensional logic."}
{"prompt": "Should I use FLOWROLL for sparse data or only dense time series?", "completion": "Dense series work better. Sparse data with gaps causes FLOWROLL to return blanks for incomplete windows."}
{"prompt": "Is it better to have multiple small DIMMATCH operations or one large alignment?", "completion": "One large alignment is more efficient. Multiple small DIMMATCH calls add unnecessary computational overhead."}
{"prompt": "Can FLOWROLL handle irregular period lengths or only uniform periods?", "completion": "Works with irregular lengths if periods are chronologically ordered. FLOWROLL counts periods, not duration."}
{"prompt": "Should I use DIMMATCH for every cross-dimensional calculation or selectively?", "completion": "Selectively. Use DIMMATCH when you need structural alignment. Simple cross-dimensional math may not need it."}
{"prompt": "Is BACKWARD direction more common than FORWARD in business applications?", "completion": "Yes. Most business analysis looks at historical trends (BACKWARD), while FORWARD is mainly for planning scenarios."}
{"prompt": "Would FLOWROLL benefit from pre-aggregated data or work directly on transactions?", "completion": "Works on both. Pre-aggregation might improve performance but FLOWROLL handles transaction-level data fine."}
{"prompt": "Should I create helper line items before DIMMATCH or apply it directly?", "completion": "Apply directly when possible. Helper line items add maintenance burden without significant benefit in most cases."}
{"prompt": "Is PeriodCount based on calendar periods or business periods?", "completion": "Based on whatever period structure your model uses. Calendar, fiscal, or custom - FLOWROLL just counts sequential periods."}
{"prompt": "Can DIMMATCH handle circular references or will it break?", "completion": "Will break. Circular references cause calculation errors. Ensure your dimensional mappings form directed acyclic graphs."}
{"prompt": "Should I use FLOWROLL in base formulas or derived calculations?", "completion": "Both work. Use where it makes sense analytically - base for fundamental metrics, derived for secondary analysis."}
