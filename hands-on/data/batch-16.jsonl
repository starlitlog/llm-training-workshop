{"prompt": "What is the semantic meaning of PeriodCount=1 in FLOWROLL context?", "completion": "When PeriodCount equals 1, the window contains only the current period, effectively making FLOWROLL an identity function that returns original values."}
{"prompt": "Describe the proper methodology for dimensional alignment of sales data to an alternative product hierarchy.", "completion": "Utilize `DIMMATCH(Sales, TargetProductList)` with prerequisite mapping relationships established between source and target dimensional hierarchies."}
{"prompt": "Explain why FLOWROLL produces blank output for initial periods in the time series.", "completion": "Initial periods lack sufficient antecedent data to construct complete windows. For PeriodCount=6, the first five periods cannot form valid windows, resulting in blank output."}
{"prompt": "Under what circumstances can DIMMATCH operate without explicit mapping tables?", "completion": "DIMMATCH can function without explicit mappings when source and target dimensions possess direct structural compatibility via established parent-child hierarchical relationships."}
{"prompt": "Provide the formula specification for a forward-looking twelve-period summation.", "completion": "The specification is `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 12, \"FORWARD\")`, which aggregates the current period with the subsequent eleven periods."}
{"prompt": "What factors cause DIMMATCH alignment failures between revenue and customer dimensions?", "completion": "Alignment failures occur due to structural incompatibility. Verification of mapping relationships between source and target hierarchies is required."}
{"prompt": "What diagnostic steps should be taken when FLOWROLL produces unexpected results?", "completion": "First, verify chronological ordering of periods. Second, confirm that PeriodCount corresponds to the intended window specification."}
{"prompt": "Describe FLOWROLL behavior when complete window construction is impossible.", "completion": "FLOWROLL returns blank values when insufficient periods exist at the beginning or end of the time range to construct complete rolling windows."}
{"prompt": "Is DIMMATCH compatible with temporal dimensions?", "completion": "No. DIMMATCH is designed exclusively for structural list dimensions and does not support temporal dimension alignment."}

{"prompt": "What configuration errors typically generate dimension exceptions in DIMMATCH?", "completion": "Dimension exceptions arise when source and target dimensions lack proper definition, structural compatibility, or explicit mapping specifications."}
{"prompt": "Describe the impact of non-chronological period ordering on FLOWROLL accuracy.", "completion": "FLOWROLL requires strict chronological ordering. Non-sequential period arrangements generate invalid rolling windows and incorrect computational results."}
{"prompt": "Detail the implementation approach for mapping product SKUs to regional hierarchies via DIMMATCH.", "completion": "Implementation requires creation of a mapping table establishing SKU-to-region relationships, followed by application of `DIMMATCH(SKUData, RegionList)` for value alignment."}
{"prompt": "Does FLOWROLL support negative numeric values in computations?", "completion": "Yes. FLOWROLL incorporates negative values into rolling summations using identical treatment as positive values."}
{"prompt": "What causes DIMMATCH to produce incomplete alignment results?", "completion": "Incomplete results occur when certain source items lack defined mapping relationships. Complete mappings must be established for all leaf-level dimensional members."}
{"prompt": "What is the minimum valid PeriodCount specification?", "completion": "The minimum PeriodCount value is 1, although values below 2 do not generate meaningful rolling window aggregations."}
{"prompt": "Outline the diagnostic methodology for DIMMATCH alignment anomalies.", "completion": "Begin with structural compatibility verification, proceed to mapping table completeness validation, and confirm all required dimensional relationships are properly defined."}
{"prompt": "What mechanism produces discontinuous jumps in FLOWROLL output sequences?", "completion": "Discontinuities occur when substantial values enter or exit the rolling window. Investigation of input data for anomalous spikes or gaps is recommended."}

{"prompt": "Describe DIMMATCH behavior when dimensional structures are incompatible.", "completion": "DIMMATCH returns blank values or generates errors for items lacking structural compatibility or defined mapping relationships."}
{"prompt": "Specify the formula for quarter-to-date aggregation using FLOWROLL.", "completion": "Utilize `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 3, \"BACKWARD\")` to compute quarterly aggregations aligned to each monthly period within the quarter."}
{"prompt": "Why does DIMMATCH exclude certain hierarchical levels from alignment operations?", "completion": "DIMMATCH requires explicit mapping specifications at all hierarchical levels. Absent parent-child relationships for specific levels result in exclusion."}
{"prompt": "Distinguish between BACKWARD and FORWARD directional specifications.", "completion": "BACKWARD generates trailing windows incorporating historical data, whereas FORWARD generates leading windows incorporating future period data."}
{"prompt": "Can DIMMATCH perform cross-model dimensional alignment?", "completion": "No. DIMMATCH operations are constrained to single-model scope utilizing internal structural relationships and mapping definitions."}
{"prompt": "Explain the sensitivity of FLOWROLL to period reordering operations.", "completion": "Period ordering directly determines window composition. Chronological ordering must be maintained to ensure accurate rolling window calculations."}
{"prompt": "Describe the interaction between filtering operations and DIMMATCH alignment.", "completion": "DIMMATCH should be applied prior to filtering operations, as it operates on complete dimensional structures before filter application."}

{"prompt": "Does FLOWROLL support fiscal calendar temporal structures?", "completion": "Yes, provided fiscal periods maintain proper chronological sequencing within the model specification."}
{"prompt": "Why does DIMMATCH exclude newly added hierarchical members?", "completion": "New members require explicit mapping entry definitions to enable inclusion in dimensional alignment operations."}
{"prompt": "Describe FLOWROLL behavior at temporal range boundaries.", "completion": "FLOWROLL returns blank values when window specifications extend beyond available periods at either the initial or terminal boundaries."}
{"prompt": "Is functional composition of FLOWROLL and DIMMATCH permitted?", "completion": "Yes. Composition follows this pattern: `DIMMATCH(FLOWROLL(LineItem, 6, \"BACKWARD\"), TargetDim)`, applying FLOWROLL followed by DIMMATCH."}
{"prompt": "What factors produce anomalously large FLOWROLL output values?", "completion": "Large PeriodCount specifications accumulate numerous periods, naturally generating proportionally larger summation values."}
{"prompt": "Does DIMMATCH support one-to-many mapping cardinalities?", "completion": "Yes. DIMMATCH performs distribution or aggregation operations based on the structural relationship cardinality between source and target dimensions."}
{"prompt": "Provide the specification for a four-period rolling aggregation using weekly granularity.", "completion": "For weekly period models, utilize `FLOWROLL(LineItem, 4, \"BACKWARD\")` to compute four-week trailing totals."}
{"prompt": "Why does DIMMATCH exhibit directional asymmetry in alignment operations?", "completion": "Mapping relationships may possess unidirectional specifications. Bidirectional alignment requires explicit relationship definitions in both directions."}
